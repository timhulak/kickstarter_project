#Kickstarter Data Report Questions:

1. What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?
	1. Creativity and arts projects appear to be the most popular type of campaign. The top four categories that Kickstarter campaigns are attempting to fund are theater, music, technology, and film & video. 

	2. Within the theater category, plays tower over all other sub-categories with 694 successful campaigns, 19 live campaigns, and 353 cancelled campaigns (a total of 1,066 campaigns). The next highest sub-category is rock music with 260 campaigns.   

	3. ALL of the journalism campaigns were cancelled! There were spikes in cancellations in the month of July (five cancellations in 2014 and 3 cancellations in 2016 totaling eight cancellations in the month of July between 2014 - 2017 for journalism campaigns).  


2. What are some of the limitations of this dataset?
	a. While they can be considered "major countries," there are only 21 of the 195 countries in the world.
	b. The gender ratio of campaign-backers is not included. Perhaps even racial/socioeconomic breakdowns.  
	c. If the money collected for a successful campaign was actually used to fund the described project. 
	d. The city/province/state that the campaign was based in for more specific demographic information.   


3. What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?
	a. Using the data analysis Add-in from the Data tab on the ribbon, in an effort to analyze correlation, we could run a regression analysis on the data to test for R Square and coefficients. 
	b. A pivot table and pivot bar chart/line cart could be made to visualize/analyze average donations by country/sub-category to see what sort of causes certain countries tend to support.
